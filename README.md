#PatchCamelyonMLProject
Theory of Machine Learning - Final Project

Uses PatchCamelyon (PCam) medical imaging dataset to implement the following machine learning methods:

Transfer Learning - uses Path Foundation Model to extract embeddings from dataset and implements 3 classifiers including Multi-Layer Perceptron, Logistic Regression, and the HistGradientBoost ensemble classifier to train, validate, and test
Convolutional Neural Networks - creates basic CNN using PCam images and compare test accuracy to rotation-equivariant CNN
Generative Adversarial Networks - generates high-fidelity pathological image samples and investigates performance
Autoencoders - trains autoencoder neural network, updates encoder and decoder parameters
Main branch - includes transfer learning (Path Foundation), classifiers, and standard CNN implementation to PCam Master branch - includes GAN and authoencoders implementation
